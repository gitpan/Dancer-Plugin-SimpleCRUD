        patch to fix it - cheers!

        Added support to search when in the listing page;
        Code refactoring - thanks to ambs for both!

        Remove dependency on SQL::Abstract, use the convenience methods now
        provided by Dancer::Plugin::Database instead.  Thanks to Jonathan
        Berber for prompting this via RT #68040, reporting that setting
        SQL::Abstract's quote_char to a backtick causes the generated queries to
        be invalid for PostgreSQL.

        Discard render_with_layout bodgery in favour of using
